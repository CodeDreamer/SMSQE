(document last amended for version 3.24)

Please look  to the file "whats_new_txt"  to see what's new  in this version of
SMSQ/E!


Content of this document :

	 1 - Compiling the source code.
	 2 - Additional programs.
	 3 - Changes to the source code.


1 - Compiling the source code

You can compile the sources either the "easy way" or the "hard way".

The  easy way is to  use the program called  "extras_exe_SMSQEMake". There is a
help text for this in the "extras_help" directory. It exists either as a simple
text file (SMSQEMake_txt) or as a Quill Doc file (SMSQEMake_doc). This explains
how to compile the sources.


If  you want  to do  this the  "hard way"  (why?), there  is a	document called
"HowTo" in  the subdirectory "extras_help".  Please note that  this document is
now outdated and will not be kept up to date. It exists either as a simple text
file (HowTo_txt) or as a Quill Doc  file  (HowTo_doc)  and  tells  you	how  to
compile  SMSQ/E for your target.  Some	familiarity with assembling and linking
is presumed.


2 - Additional programs

I have created	several new subdirectories  as compared to  the original source
code that came from Tony Tebby and put them all into one subdirectory called


 - extras

   this has several new subdirectories itself:

    _exe
    _help
    _new
    _doc
    _html
    _source
    _old

The  _help subdirectory will contain the help files, as and when they are made.
Help files are there  to explain  how some  programs work,  not how  new SMSQ/E
features work.

The _exe subdirectory contains additional programs that are useful or essential
for compiling the source code.

The _doc directory contains documentation on new features.

The _new  subdirectory contains documentation on features  that are new to THIS
version  of SMSQ/E. In the next version,  this documentation is moved to either
the _doc or the _help subdirectories.

The  _html subdirectory contains programs generating some of the html files for
the smsqe website.

The _source  subdirectory contains the source files  for the non basic programs
found in the dev8_extras_ and dev8_extras_exe_ subdirectories.

The  _old subdirectory contains old basic files  no longer used or necessary in
more modern versions of the sources.

The "extras"  directory itself contains additional  programs, mostly those used
by myself  in an attempt to make compilation  easier. Any program put into that
directory should have a corresponding help file in the help directory.


3 - Changes to the source code.

The document "changes_txt",  in the root  directory, tracks the  changes to the
source code as and when they are made.
