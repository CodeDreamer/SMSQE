# SMSQE
History of SMSQ/E source changes.

SMSQ/E is an operating system written by Tony Tebby in the 90s and currently mantained and further enhanced by other authors. It is partially compatible with the QODS operating sytem that Tony Tebby wrote for the Sinclair QL home computer in the 80s. SMSQ/E was open sourced in January 2013.

This repository is a mirror of the public SMSQ/E sources as published on the "old versions" page (http://www.wlenerz.com/smsqe/oldversions.html) of the official SMSQ/E web site.

There is one commit for each version to make it easy to compare them and see what lines of code changed in each version.

SMSQ/E/QDOS executable files are stored in the Q-emuLator format to preserve the QDOS file headers and the *con* and *nul* files have been renamed as those names are illegal in Windows.

For instructions on how to build SMSQ/E from sources, see extras/help/how_to_txt.
