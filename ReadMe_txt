Please look to the file whats_new_txt to see what's new in this version
of SMSQ/E!



1 - Compiling the source code
2 - Additional programs
3 - Changes to the source code.


1 - Compiling the source code


There is a document called "HowTo" in the subdirectory "help".

It exists either as a simple text file (HowTo_txt) or as a Quill Doc file
(HowTo_doc).

This tells you how to compile SMSQ/E for your target.  Some familiarity with
assembling and linking is presumed.


2 - Additional programs

I have created three new subdirectories as compared to the original source
code that came from Tony Tebby:

 - help
 - exe
 - extras
 - doc

The help directory will contain the help files, as and when they are made.

The exe directory contains additional programs that are useful or essential
for compiling the source code.

The extras directory contains additional programs, mostly those used by myself
in an attempt to make compilation easier. Any program put into that directory
should have a corresponding help file in the help directory.

The doc directory contains documentation on new features.

3 - Changes to the source code.

The document "changes_txt", in the root directory, tracks the changes to the
source code as and when they are made.
