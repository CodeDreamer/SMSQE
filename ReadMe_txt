of SMSQ/E!



1 - Compiling the source code
2 - Additional programs
3 - Changes to the source code.


1 - Compiling the source code


There is a document called "HowTo" in the subdirectory "extras_help".

It exists either as a simple text file (HowTo_txt) or as a Quill Doc file
(HowTo_doc).

This tells you how to compile SMSQ/E for your target.  Some familiarity with
assembling and linking is presumed.


2 - Additional programs

I have created several new subdirectories as compared to the original source
code that came from Tony Tebby and put them all into one subdirectory called


 - extras

   this has several new subdirectories itself:

   _exe
   _help
   _new
   _doc


The help subdirectory will contain the help files, as and when they are made.

The exe subdirectory contains additional programs that are useful or essential
for compiling the source code.

The doc directory contains documentation on new features.

The new subdirectory contain documentation on features that are new to
THIS version of SMSQ/E.

In the next version, this documentation is moved to either the _doc or the
_help subdirecotories.


The extras directory itself contains additional programs, mostly those used by
myself in an attempt to make compilation easier. Any program put into that
directory should have a corresponding help file in the help directory.


3 - Changes to the source code.

The document "changes_txt", in the root directory, tracks the changes to the
source code as and when they are made.
