SMSQEMake

(NOTE a less succint description  of the  program and  how to  use it  can be
found in the SMSQ/E reference manual, annex  1.  This  can  be	found  on  my
website - www.wlenerz.com/qlstuff -  in the documentation section).

This  is a program to  "build" SMSQ/E for one  or several targets. "Building"
means that the various assembler files are "assembled" and then "linked" into
modules which are then "made" into one single SMSQ/E file.

Targets
The  targets are the machines for which SMSQ/E is to be built. They are shown
in  a line of loose menu items. You can (de)select each target by clicking an
it. Only selected targets will be built.

Modules
For each target there are a  certain  number  of  modules  that  need  to  be
assembled  and	linked.  The  modules  for  each  target  are  shown  in  the
application  sub-window (their names end in "_link"). Only those modules that
are selected will be treated.


I - Presentation of the program

A - Loose menu items
There  are two rows of loose  menu items at the top  of the window. The first
row contains (from left to right):

- ESC	leave the program
- MOVE	change window position
- SIZE	change window size by in/de-creasing the application window
- DEL	If this item is selected, all targets and intermediary files (error,
	rel and lib files) will be deleted before compilation begins
- SaT	sets all targets to "selected"
- DIR	sets the directory where the files to be "made" can be found (dev8_
	by default)
- ?	shows version information
- OK	starts the build process
- All	selects or deselects all modules for all selected targets
- Make	if selected, the selected target will be made. If not, the individual
	assembler files will just be assembled.
- SLEEP puts the program to sleep behind a button

The second row contains the list of targets.

The ESC, Move, Size and Sleep loose menu items all use the standard keys. For
the other loose menu items, the selection key is underlined in each item.

B - The application sub-window
The application sub-window  contains the  list of  modules for	each selected
target. When building  the targets, only  those modules that  are selected in
the  application sub-window will be treated. This  means that you do not have
to  re-make all  modules for  a target,  if there  was an  error in  only one
module. You cannot choose the individual  assembler  files  that  make	up  a
module.




II - Using the program

Select	the targets you wish to be built.  Using the SaT item will select all
of them.

Select	the modules that are to be (re)-made. Using  the All item will select
all of them.

Possibly  select the DEL item. Be aware,  however, that DEL is not selective:
it  deletes ALL intermediary, module  and target files, not only the ones for
selected targets or modules. This means that you need to re-build all modules
for all targets.

Select the Make item.

Hit the OK button.

The program  now treats every module  that is selected. If  the process for a
module did not result in an error (i.e. assembling and linking went OK), then
the module  is made available again.  This allows you to  see in which module
there was an error.

If  the entire process	went OK, the  program has made	all modules available
again. If not, a small window pops up telling you that there was an error (it
doesn't tell you  where the  error was,  though -  just look  which module(s)
remained selected, then look  in the  source code  at the  log file  for each
module).


III - Command line options.
When executing SMSQEMake,  you can pass  it some command  line switches. They
are all two letters long and are preceded by a hyphen. They are:

A - General

Name	Meaning
-qa	Quit after program finishes
-q0	Quit if 0 errors
-as	Autostart: start building as soon as program is launched
-mk	"Make" item is selected
-de	Select DEL item: Delete all rel,lib and target files before building
-sa	All item is selected: select all modules
-fa	Force assembly of all files
-ta	Select all targets


B - Target selection

Then there are	command line switches  to select individual  targets (but not
modules):

Name	Target
-tg	Generic SMSQ/E - routines used by nearly all targets
-ti	Atari
-to	(Super) Gold card
-tq	Q40
-tx	QXL
-tu	Aurora
-tj	SMSQmulator
-tr	PtrGen
-tc	QPC
-t8	Q68
-tm	Q-emulator
