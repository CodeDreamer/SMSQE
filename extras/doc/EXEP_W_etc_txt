EXEP_M and FEP_M
These two keywords behave like EXEP and FEP, respectively, except that the
owner of the job being created and executed is Me, i.e. the job issuing
these commands.


EXEP_W and FEP_W
These two keywords behave like EXEP_M and FEP_M, respectively, except that the
the job issuing these commends is sueen,ded until the created job terminates.
(like EXEC_W).


Have fun!
