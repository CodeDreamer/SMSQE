From version 3.06 onwards, SMSQ/E allows you yo use a sprite for a cursor.
The sprite to be used as a cursor:

	- MUST be of size 6x10 (WxH), else it will not be used.
	- MUST be the one set at position 36 in the system sprites
	- MUST be showable in the current screen resolution

If any of the above conditions is not met, then the normal cursor is shown.

How to load a cursor sprite
---------------------------
You may load a cursor sprite with the CURSPRLOAD command:

CURSPRLOAD filename.

This loads "filename" and uses it as a cursor sprite.
Please make sure that this file only contains the sprite data for a valid
cursor sprite. The command does NOT check this. If this command seems to fail,
i.e. the cursor sprite doesn't change to what you want it to be, the data
contained in this file is perhaps not a valid cursor sprite for the current
screen resolution.

		

How to use a sprite as cursor.
--------------------------------
On a system-wide basis:

  Configure your system. As of version 3.06 of SMSQ/E, a new configration item
  lets you configure whether you want to use sprites as cursor or not.

On a per job basis

  Independently of your system-wide cofiguration, you may switch the use of a
  sprite to be used for the cursor on a per job basis.

  * From SBASIC

    Use the keywords CURSPRON and CURSPROFF:
    CURSPRON job_name or job_number,job_tag
    Example: Let us suppose you have Xchange running on your machine.
    Typing 'jobs' will tell you more about this job, something like this:

    Job Tag   Owner  Priority  Job-Name
	 (...)
     9	 8	0    8	  Xchange V3.90J

    You can now switch using the sprite cursor on/off by:
    CURSPRON "Xchange V3.90J"
    or
    CURSOROFF 9,8


  * From machine code
    There is a new CON vector, pv_cursp, that sets the per job cursor
    as follows:


;+++
;  PV_CURSP				$1E
;
;  Call parameters			Return parameters
;  D0					D0   error
;  D1	jobID				D1   smashed
;  D2	status wished (0|1)		D2   preserved
;  D3					D3   preserved
;
;  A0					A0   preserved
;  A1					A1   preserved
;  A2					A2   preserved
;  A3	pointer to CON linkage block	A3   preserved
;---
; errors
;	IJOB	wrong job ID
;	NIMP	something went horribly wrong : no job table!
;+++

    The status in D2 is 0 if normal cursor, 1 if sprite cursor wished

    You can use this vector as follows, assuming A0 points to the system
    variables (include the files dev8_keys_sys and dev8_keys_con in your
    code for this to work):

	move.l	sys_clnk(a0),a1 	; point to dddb
	move.l	pt_vecs(a1),a1		; point to vectors
	moveq	#-1,d1			; set cursor for myself
	moveq	#0,d2			; use old cursor
	jsr	pt_cursp(a1)		; do it now
	(....)





Finally, yhere is a new keyword to set any sprite as a system sprite

SYSSPRLOAD system_sprite_number,file_name$

load the file and sets it as the system sprite with the given number.

Please make sure that this file only contains the sprite data for a valid
sprite. The command does NOT check this. If this command seems to fail,
i.e. the corresponding system sprite doesn't change to what you want it to be,
the data contained in this file is perhaps not a valid sprite for the current
screen resolution.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

There is also a command to load any file as any system sprite:

SYSSPRLOAD system_sprite_number,file_name$

load the given file and sets it as the system sprite with the given number.

Please make sure that this file only contains the sprite data for a valid
sprite. The command does NOT check this. If this command seems to fail,
i.e. the corresponding system sprite doesn't change to what you want it to be,
the data contained in this file is perhaps not a valid sprite for the current
screen resolution.
      
	      

Have fun.
QL forever!
