Del_all_bas


This little basic program (in the extras subdirectory) will delete
all  lib, rel, err, map and log  files and all targets compiled on
dev8_.


To  use   this  program  (the  procedures   used  should  be  self
explanatory), you  need the cline_bin extension,  which adds a new
keyword  "Current_line" (see the  help file for  cline). Just load
this file with LRESPR. You  can  find  this  file  in  the  extras
directory.  You also need the "blinker_bin" file, also loaded with
LRESPR and also in  the extras  directory (see  the help  file for
that).


I use the del_all program for two reasons:

-  to make sure, every time I recompile something, that everything
is recompiled afresh.  This way,  the compiler/linker  might catch
some errors.

-  to delete all of the non essentials files when distributing the
source (it makes for smaller zip files).
