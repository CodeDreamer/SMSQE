         This little basic program (in the extras subdirectory) will delete
         all of the lib files and targets compiled on dev8_.
         
         To  use   this  program  (the  procedures   used  should  be  self
         explanatory), you  need the cline_bin extension,  which adds a new
         keyword  "Current_line" (see below). You can find this file in the
         extras directory.
         
         I use this for two reasons:
         
         -  to make sure, every time I recompile something, that everything
         is recompiled afresh.  This way,  the compiler/linker  might catch
         some errors.
         
         - to delete  all of the  targets when distributing  the source, in
         compliance with the licence.  
         
         
         Cline_bin
         
         
         This  will   add  a  new  keyword,   CURRENT_LINE  to  the  Sbasic
         interpreter.  This keyword returns the line number on which it was
         called (0 if called directly from the command line).
         
         You should  avoid  using  this  keyword  from  within  a  compiled
         program. For QLIB,  this keywords returns  0  due to  a fluke, but
         nothing is guaranteed. I don't think it will crash your machine if
         used from within a compiled program, but it might...
