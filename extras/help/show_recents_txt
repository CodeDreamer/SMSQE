This little program just shows lists of files maintained by the recent
thing.

At the onset, it shows the general list. The "Jobs" item show the names
of all jobs for which the Recent thing currently has a list. Clicking
on a job then shows the files for that job.

The "Info" item displays info on the list held for the current job (or on the
general list).

Clicking on any of the files will put its name in the stuffer buffer.

The source code for the program is provided.

If you want to recompile it yourself, you will need the Qptr extensions, as well
as the outptr_bin and blinker_bin extensions, both of which are in the zip file.
There is one big "bas" file, or, if you use the Basic Linker, the individual _bas
files. You will then also need the library files I usually use, they can be
found at www.wlenerz.com/QLStuff   (basic_lib.zip).
