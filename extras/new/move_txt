As of version 3.01 of SMSQ/E, new ways of moving a window about the screen
have been added.


There are now three ways a window be moved:


0 - the old way - the pointer changes to the "move window" sprite which is
moved about the screen.

1 - "Outline": click on the move icon with the MOUSE - KEEP HOLDING THE BUTTON
DOWN, an outline of the window appears which you can move around and position
where you want it. Release the mouse button and the window positions itself
correctly.

Please note that you cannot use this move mode with anything but the mouse - the
keyboard (cursor keys) will not work.


3 - "Full window". This is the same as 1 above, but instead of an outline, the
entire window is moved. For Q40/Q60 users, switching onthe Cache is advisable...

Please note that you cannot use this move mode with anything but the mouse - the
keyboard (cursor keys) will not work.


The move modes are configured on a system-wide basis - you cannot have one
job moving in mode 0 and the other in mode 1.

Thus, all jobs are affected by the move mode, even those written a long time
ago (unless, such as Qlib, the job doesn't use the WMAN move routine).

The move mode can be changed in two ways:

1 - Configure SMSQ/E  (WMAN) to a mode of your liking.

2 - Use the new WM_MOVEMODE keyword

This takes one parameter, an integer from 0 to 2:

WM_MOVEMODE 0 : the old way

WM_MOVEMODE 1 : the "outline" move

WM_MOVEMODE 2 : the "full window" move


Enjoy
