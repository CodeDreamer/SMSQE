Q68 faster SD card driver.

Two features have been implemented in newer versions of the Q68 firmware:
				      =============


1 - 16 bit transfer instead of 8 bit transfer
This means then when transferring data to/from the card, it can be read/written
by word sized operations instead of byte sized operations. This might make the
Q68 a little bit faster at every transfer of data to/from the SD Card.

2 - 40Mhz speed for SD Card transfer.
Normal transfer between the SD Card and the Q68 is done at 25 Mhz, in
compliance with the specifications for SD cards.
It has been experimentally found that it is possible to speed up the transfer
to 40 Mhz. This, again, may give a slightly faster transfer speed. HOWEVER:
USING THIS 40 MHz SPEED IS USING THE SD CARDS OUTSIDE THEIR SPECIFICATIONS. IT
COULD CONCEIVABLY DESTROY THE CARD AND/OR THE DATA THAT IS ON IT.
TEST THIS EXTENSIVELY WITH EACH AND EVERY CARD YOU WANT TO USE (and be
prepared to have it destroyed). USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
To avoid this being accidentally switched on, you must configure the SMSQE file,
there you can switch this on individually for each drive.


Using the 16 bit transfer is perfectly safe (and automatic if the firmware can
handle it).


NOTE: BOTH FACILITIES NEED NEWER VERSIONS OF THE FIRMWARE

You can easily find out whether you have a firmware that allows this, simply by
using the new CARD_SPEEDUP function :

PRINT CARD_SPEEDUP will print 1 if you have a firmaware that can use 16-bit
transfer and 40 Mhz transfer speed, 0 if not.
