yAs of versions 3.00, this file contains a brief overview of what is new in
each version of SMSQ/E.


A more detailed description of the changes made to the source code itself
is contained in changes_txt.

Moreover, there is a directory called "New" in the "extras" subdirectory.

This contains documentation on the new features that are introduced with
new versions of SMSQ/E, to the extent that such documentation exists.
Please note that, for the sake of completeness, the same documentation also
exists in the "extras_doc" directory. For each new version of SMSQ/E, the content
of the "extras_new" directory is erased and only the documentation/description
of new features are kept in that "extras_new" directory.


This here file only contains a short description of the new features.

Spanish keyboard and system messages are handled.
Better handling of drive names via iof.xinf.
Q68, cards need not be initilized for normal access.
Qx0 can read contaziner files from the first four partitions.
WIN drives made removale for SMsQmulator


=====
3.33
=====

Final bugfix for LRESPR in procedures.
Better QL networking.
Gold card is configured not to use ABC keyboard.
Improvements in standard QL EE.
Q68 & SMSQmulator better SSSS handling.
Stand-alone TK II and QL-SD replacement drivers are included in the SMSQ/E sources.
Qx0 may have a compressed SMSQ/E so newer versions fit in the EPROMs.


=====
3.32
=====

Bugfixes:
There are various bugfixes for network drive names resolution.
QPC & SMSQmulator use the correct SQRT replacement routines.
QPC better handling of removable drives.

Additional features:
Filesystem for FAT16 disks of up to 256 MiB (currently only ysed in Q68).
Filesystem for QUBide drives.

Q40/Q60:
It is now possible to use IDE hard disks formatted with FAT32 and contining
QXL.WIN "drives" (see explanation in the extras_new directory).
The purpose of this is to allow easier data exchange between the Qx0 and the
rest of the QL world : Adapters exist which will plug into the Q40 IDE connector
and can read SDHC memory cards. If you format such a card on FAT32, you can
exchange QXL.WIN drives easily!

it would be moved to that directory, the directory is NOT created. Note: in
that case an empty file with the name ofthat directory will have been created.
In other words : when you create a directory, don't have channels open to files
that would have to be moved into the new directory .

SMSQmulator uses the SMSQ/E dv3 drivers for floppy access.

======
 3.14
======
A new SMSQE version, for SMSQmulator  (subdir smsq_java)


======
 3.13
======

Several bugfixes.

For QXL users, the keyboard LEDs should work now.
QPC Numlock should work now.
New CTRL+C behaviour - instead of poppoing up the last jobs on the window
stack, it'll pop up the least recently used job.

Background IO made configurable.
New keywords (functions) YEAR%, MONTH% DAY%, and WEEKDAY%
DAY%,MONTH% and YEAR% return the day/month/year of a certain date (same
parameters as for DATE$)
WEEKDAY% returns the day of the week  (Monday = 1, tuesday = 2 etc) (same parameters as for DATE$)

Faster job execution.


======
 3.12
======

Background drawing: Even when a window is partially covered, printing into
this window continues. This goes with two new BAsic commands: PE_BGON to
turn this feature on, PE_BGOFF to turn this feature off.  By default, this
feature is TURNED OFF, so use the PE_BGON command in your boot file
if you want to keep it on.


Better support for the Home thing.

Improved Qx0 cache handling.

Improved History device.

Basic has a new command line history: if you press the up/down arrows, you get
the latest commands entered.

New Basic command JOBID:
result = JOBID [({nr, tag} | <name> )] named job id or my id (no parameters)


Jochen Merz donated the source code for the "uti" and "util_menus" libraries
to the SMSQE source code. Hence, the libraries are no longer used, we use
the direct files instead.

New commands POKE_F, POKES_F,PEEK_F, PEEKS_F for flaoting point poking/peeking


======
 3.11
======

Support for the home thing.


======
 3.10
======

Cursor Sprite Clipping is implemented:

The cursor sprite, when reaching the edges of the screen is "clipped" until its
origin.

Sprites with no (= solid) masks are implemented. These take less space.

Some bugfixes.


======
 3.09
======

The GET_HOTSTUFF$ command is introduced.

This permits you to get at the content of the stuffer buffer.

Syntax:

a$=GET_HOTSTUFF$(parameter)

If no parameter, or parameter = 0: get the current content (same as ALT SPACE).
If parameter = -1: get the previous content (same as ALT SHIFT SPACE).


It is possible to restart the QXL SMSQE by typing SMSQE / under DOS.


The Qx0 code no longer contains the cachecontrol module, please use Mark
Swift's extentions again (on which this module is based, anyway).

The Qx0 in ROM starts with the cache disabled again.



======
 3.08
======
(nothing)


======
 3.07
======

There is a new keyword:
EX_M: This behaves a bit like EX in that the calling job continues executing
(like EX and contray to EW) but the job created is owned by the calling job
(like EW). This means that if you get rid of the calling job, you will also get
rid of the created job(s).

A treat for QXL owners: Thanks to Bruno COATIVY, you can now configure
what dos drive letters (C:, D: etc) corresponds to win1_, win2_ etc...
Just configure the new SMSQE.EXE file, under the "Host" section.

The Q40 flp density workaround in v. 3.06 now works. This is a 1 byte change
in 1 source file, and I still managed to get it wrong!


======
 3.06
======
The "Quit" keyword takes an optional parameter (long int) that is passed to
the calling job. For example, you could have two basic programs,
the first calling the second with
   return_code=FEW(your_second_program)

The Q40 flp density is preset to High (1.44 MB disks). This is a workaround
for a bug that stops flp format working if the drive was never accessed before
and no flp density was set explicitly. If you want to format other density
disks you must set the density to D or E.

Sprites (of 6x10 size) may be used as cursor. See the documentation in
dev8_extras_new_cursor_txt

Attempt to have Gold Card Miracle hard disks working again.


=============
 3.04 & 3.05
=============
Simple bug fixes.
Display bug fix.
The smsqemake_exe program takes new parameters (see the doc in the
_extras_help dir).


======
 3.03
======
1 - Many bugfixes.

2 - A new cachecontrol module for the Q60, based on Code kindly supplied by
Mark Swift.
This introduces three new keywords which were contained in Mark Swift's
Cachemodes toolkit that comes with the Qx0:

SERIALIZED
This turns the Caches OFF

WRITETHROUGH
This command turns the "writethrough" cache mode of 68040 &
68060 processors ON. Writing to a memory address writes both to the
cache and to memory, so cache and memory are always in sync.


COPYBACK
This command turns the copyback cache mode of 68040 & 68060
processors ON. Enabling the COPYBACK cache can give substantial
speed increases. Writing to a memory address will write to the
cache, but not to memory until absolutely necessary. Thus cache
and memory are rarely in sync.
This can lead to some incompatibilities.
With these three keywords, you can use the cache mode you want.
You can configure in what state your machine should boot.

3 -Left and right shift keys are handled separately:
Up to now, if you pressed both shift keys at once and then released only one,
the system also considered that you had released the other.

4 - INPUT uses F10 (or any other configured keystroke) to put the content of
the "console" channel into the stuffer buffer in a READ/EDIT line trap (only!).
You can configure the keystroke with the usual configuration program.
You must input a number between 0 and 255. This corresponds to the keycode
of the key in question.
If you are unsure about what key produces what code, you could do the following:
Type in:    PRINT CODE ( INKEY$ (-1) )
followed by Enter into any Sbasic.
Now hit the key you want to use. The corresponding number will be printed
on the screen.
This is 250 for the suggested F10 key.

Bugfixes


======
 3.01
======

Apart from some small bugfixes , in this version there is a new routine to
move the windows about the screen.

There are now three ways this can be done:

0 - the old way - the pointer changes to the "move window" sprite which is
moved about the screen.

1 - "Outline": the outline of the window is moved with the mouse

2 - Full window : the entire indow is moved with the mouse

Please read the "move_txt' documentation for more details.


On a more anecdotical scale, the doc, exe, help, new subdirectories
have all been moved into the extras subdirectory.


There is also a new program that will (or is supposed to) make compilation
of the sources a bit easier. This is  extras_exe_smsqemake. The documentation
is in extras_help_smsqemake_doc or _txt


----
