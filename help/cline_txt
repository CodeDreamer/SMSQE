         This  will   add  a  new  keyword,   CURRENT_LINE  to  the  Sbasic
         interpreter.  This keyword returns the line number on which it was
         called (0 if called directly from the command line).
         
         You should  avoid  using  this  keyword  from  within  a  compiled
         program. For QLIB,  this keywords returns  0  due to  a fluke, but
         nothing is  guaranteed. I don't  know what happens  with Turbo. In
         any  case, I don't think  it will crash your  machine if used from
         within a compiled program, but it might... Just don't!
         
         To load the CURRENT_LINE keyword, use:
         LRESPR cline_bin.
