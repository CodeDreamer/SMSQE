The purpose of this program is to make a list of all the rel and lib files
that are used by all of the make files - this enables me to see which files
in the SMSQ/E sources are no longer used.



Please note that this program needs the "outptr_bin"  extensions to be loaded.

They can be found in the exe_source directory
