For help on using the drivers, please read the _doc or _text file.
If you want to modify or just recompile the drivers there are three link files
for three different targets:

 - rom_link	makes a version to put into the QL-SD chip.
 - respr_link	makes a version to be loaded with (L)RESPR.
 - resprWQ_link makes a version With Qubide to be loaded with (L)RESPR.
		This allows you to read Qubide formatted container files on
		the SDHC Card.



Have fun!
