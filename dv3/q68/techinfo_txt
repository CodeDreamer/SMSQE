Drive config


The initial drive config is contained in the config block in hwinit_asm


In that file, the following info is copied to a fixed memory location,
located at q68_cfgb : the initial drive names, the drive->card table.
The drive->card table contains, for each drive, the card it is on, as follows
0  not on any drive
1  on drive 1
2  on drive 2

When the driver is initialized, the initial names of the drives are normalized
and stored above the drive->card table.

So the final format of the config info at q68_cfgb is as follows:

high memory

		       8*16 bytes for normalized drive names

  q68_cfbg+q68.norn	  -> start of normalized names

			8 bytes for table

  q68_cfgb+q68.dvtb	  -> start of drive->card table

			8 * 16 bytes for initial drive names

  q68_cfgb		  ->  start of data




low memory



							
ATTENTION HDL_TARGET IS USED AS A BUFFER DO NOT STORE INFO IN THESE 8 BYTES
