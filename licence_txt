    are not the "copyright holder" as defined herein.
    
    C - Registrar
    The registrar  is the person appointed by  the copyright holder to keep
    coherent versions  of the software and  issue official versions thereof
    from  time to time. The person, duties  and rights of the registrar are
    set out in an annex hereto.
    
    D - Resellers
    A  reseller is a  person entitled by  the copyright holder  to sell the
    binary  (i.e. compiled) code  to the end  users. A list  of the current
    resellers is appended hereto.
    
    E - Software author
    A software  author  is  either  Tony  TEBBY  or  any  person  making  a
    change/addition/modification to the software.
    
    
    2 Copyright
    
    The software is copyright  Tony TEBBY, 1990 to 2002.
    
    Additional copyright may lie with other persons. 
    
    These persons are identified in an annex hereto.
    
    
    3 Conditions of use.
    
    This software is supplied under the following conditions:
    
    
    A - Source code.
    
    In  the following paragraphs,  the term "source  code" also encompasses
    documentation as it exists under this licence.
    
    Obtaining the source code 
    Any person so  interested may  have access  to the  source code  of the
    software. To  obtain the source code, a  request in this respect should
    be made to the registrar. Such  request  should  be  accompanied  by  3
    International Reply Coupons.  The  version  of  the  source  code  thus
    distributed  via the registrar, on CDROM,  is the "official version" of
    the source code.  The registrar is  entitled to distribute  all or only
    part of the  source code and  may also distribute,  at his convenience,
    the source code via other media.
    
    Distribution of source code by others than the registrar
    Any  person may distribute the source  code to others, provided however
    that the following  conditions  are  adhered  to  by  the  person  thus
    distributing the source :
    
    - Such  a distribution must be  made entirely free of  charge - no fees
      whatsoever,  for copying or the media on which the software is copied
      or otherwise, may be levied. The distribution of the source code must
      contain a copy of this licence  and  a  clear  indication  that  this
      licence must be  read and agreed  upon by the  recipient before using
      the source code.
    
    - Such a  distribution may only be  made in either of  two forms: Via a
      CDROM or via Email.
    
    
        - Via CDROM 
        Exceptionally and only if  distribution  is  made  via  CDROM,  the
        person  distributing the source code may request 3 IRCs and a blank
        CDROM from the  recipient.  All  of  the  software,  including  the
        documentation and this licence must be distributed on the CDROM.
        
        - Via Email 
        Distribution via Email is  only allowed  if the  Email is  sent out
        individually to  the recipient  having made  the request.  A system
        whereby an Email is automatically generated by software or hardware        upon each or any request by a future recipient is NOT allowed. When
        distribution is made via Email, it is allowed to send only parts of
        the source  code  to  the  recipient,  provided  however,  that  in
        accordane with the requirement  set  out  above,  this  licence  is
        always sent together with such (part of the) source code.
        
    - Any distribution of  the  source  code  by  persons  other  than  the
      registrar results in a version that is NOT an official version of the
      source code.
    
    Compilation of source code 
    Any person may compile  the  source  code  and  thus  obtain  a  binary
    (compiled) version  and use  it for  itself. However,  unless otherwise
    provided herein, binary code may NOT be distributed.
    
    
    B - Changes/additions/modifications
    
    
    Making changes/additions/modifications
    Any  person may make any  change/addition/modification to the software,
    and  distribute it as source code together  with the source code of the
    software under the above conditions.
    
    Any  person  having  made  such  a  change/addition/modification  is  a
    software author and, of  course,  retains  entire  copyright  over  the
    change/addition/modification thus made.
    
    Such change/addition/modification may also  be  distributed  in  binary
    form, provided  however that such  a distribution does  not contain any
    part of this software in binary form.
    
    Submission of changes/additions/modifications to the registrar
    Any  person having made a  change/addition/modification to the original
    source  code  may  propose  this  change/addition/modification  to  the
    registrar for inclusion in the official version.
    
    When  such a proposal is  made, the person proposing  it may state that
    the inclusion is  to be made for  free or against payment  of a fee for
    each copy  of SMSQ/E  actually sold  containing such  a change/addition
    /modification.
    
    When such a proposal is made, the person proposing it may state whether
    its change/addition/modification is to be :
    
    -  distributed in the official versions of the source and binary codes,
    or 
    - distributed in the official versions of the binary codes only, or 
    - not distributed in the official versions, but alongside them.
    
    
    If nothing of the sort is stipulated, then it is explicitly agreed that
    the  inclusion in the official version is to be made for free, and that
    it will be distributed  with  the  source  code  and  under  this  here
    licence. Any code  distributed in  the official  version (but  not code
    only distributed alongside  the  official  version)  falls  under  this
    licence, to which the author explicitly agrees.
    
    Authors having made  a  change/addition/modification  retain  copyright
    over their own code.  The copyright  will be  acknowledged in  an annex
    hereto.
    
    By making such a proposal for inclusion, the person making the proposal
    explicitly states that the code is free from patent restrictions and it
    grants  the registrar and the copyright holder the irrevocable right to
    include the change/addition/modification in any and all future versions
    of SMSQ/E, under the same conditions.
    
    The fact  of  proposing  such  a  change/addition/modification  to  the
    registrar for inclusion in the  official  version,  whatever  the  form
    thereof, implies acceptance of these conditions.
    
    The registrar is not  obliged to  include in  official versions  of the
    software  any code  submitted to  him. However,  consent to  include it
    shall not  be withheld unreasonably.  The registrar is  free to include
    code  in one  version of  the software,  but to  exclude it  from other
    future versions of  the software.  An annex  may define  the conditions
    under which the registrar may refuse code to be included.
    
    Code  submitted to the registrar  must adhere to a  style guide, as set
    out in an annex hereto or a separate document.
    
    
    C - Binary code
    
    Unless by  prior agreement,  binary code  of the  software may  only be
    distributed by resellers.
    
    The resellers  may only  distribute binary  (compiled) versions  of the
    official version of the software as obtained from the registrar. 
    
    The distribution of the binary versions of the software is made against
    payment by the  reseller to  the software  author(s). Each  reseller is
    free  to  set   the   prices   he   wishes   for   payment   from   his
    clients/customers,  provided however, that  for each new  copy sold, an
    amount as determined in  an  annex  hereto  is  paid  to  the  software
    author(s).
    
    Such  a payment  may be  made by  the reseller  either directly  to the    software   author(s)  or  to  the  registrar.  The  registrar  is  thus
    authorized to receive and collect payment, under the explicit condition
    however,  that he MUST  not take any  payment for himself,  and that he
    MUST distribute the entire money received to the software author(s).
    
    Payment for binary versions of the software does not necessarily accrue
    on each distribution of binaries. Users having bought previous versions
    of SMSQ/E may be  entitled,  at  the  resellers'  discretion,  to  free
    upgrades for certain versions of the binaries. This necessarily implies
    that the user obtaining an upgrade must have a previous legitimate copy
    of  the SMSQ/E operating system. It  is the reselers' responsibility to
    make sure that the person in question is entitled to a free upgrade.
    
    However, the registrar, after  consultation  with  the  resellers,  may
    require  that any version of  the binaries may not  be distributed as a
    free upgrade, but that payment to the software author(s) MUST accrue on
    it.
    
    Any person may  petition Tony  TEBBY or  (preferably) the  registrar to
    become a reseller.  An authorization to  become a reseller  will not be
    unreasonably withheld. An annex hereto states the current resellers.
    
    A reseller must supply  support to  the end  user having  bought SMSQ/E
    from him.
    
    
    D - Test versions
    
    As  an exception to the prohibition  of distribution of binary versions
    of the software other  than  through  the  resellers,  you  are  hereby
    granted the right  to distribute binary  versions of the  software to a
    maximum of 10 different persons (whatever the number and moment in time
    of the  changes/additions/modifications  you  make),  provided  however
    that: 
    
    - you have made a change/addition/modification to the software compared
        to the official version and 
    -  the person receiving the software from you undertakes to destroy the
        binary version :
         
         - after 2 months of receipt thereof, 
         -  as soon as you inform such person that the version is no longer
         a test version but a final version, 
         -  as soon as any such change  has been submitted to the registrar
         and accepted by him for inclusion in the official version 
         
         whatever comes first.
         
    
    The person  receiving the binaries from you  must also undertake not to
    distribute binary versions to anybody else - except yourself- , even if
    he/she did make any change/addition/modification to the code.
    
    Even   if  you  make  several  changes/additions/modifications  to  the
    software,  you may only distribute test versions to the same 10 persons
    maximum.
    
    
    E - Developer versions
    
    The  registrar may set up a  system whereby identified software authors
    may have access to, and possibly exchange among themselves, source code
    or binary versions being actually developed.

    The registrar and inclusion of Code
    The registrar is 
    Wolfgang Lenerz 
    6, rue Daunou 
    77340 Pontault-Combault 
    France    
    The main  work of the registrar  is to make sure,  as much as possible,
    that coherent versions of  the source  code exist  for all  machines on
    which SMSQ/E runs.
    
    When code is  submitted to him  for inclusion in  the official version,
    the  registrar shall not  withhold consent to  include it unreasonably,
    but his decision in that respect is final. Code may only be excluded if
    there is a reason preventing it from being included.
    
    If  the registrar chooses not to include  any code, then he MUST inform
    the software author of the reason(s) preventing him from including this
    code. The  registrar explicitly agrees  that these reasons  may be made
    public by the software author, or others.
    
    Reasons  which may  prevent code  from being  included in  the official
    versions of the software include, but are not limited to:
    
    - Non adherence to the style guide. 
    - Probability of the code being bugged. 
    -  The fact that the code is useful  only to one machine even though it
    could be made useful to more machines without too much effort. 
    - Clashes between the  proposed code  and existing  code or  code being
    written by others. 
    - The payment requested  by the  software author  is inadequate  in the
    registrar's opinion.
    
    
    Style guide
    
    The  styleguide is  contained in  a separate  document. This  is called
    "styleguide_txt"  and  is  included  with  the  sources,  at  the  root
    directory thereof.
