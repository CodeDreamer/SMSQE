As of versions 3.00, this file contains a brief overview of what is new in
each version of SMSQ/E.


A more detailed description of the changes made to the source code itself
is contained in changes_txt.

Moreover, there is a directory called "New" in the "extras" subdirectory.

This contains documentation on the new features that are introduced with this
new version of SMSQ/E,to the extent that such documentation exists.
Please note that, for the sake of completeness, the same documentation also
exists in the "extras_doc" directory. At each new version of SMSQ/E the content
of the "extras_new" directory is erased and only the documentation/description
of new features are kept in that "extras_new" directory.


This here file only contains a short description of the new features.


What is new in versions :
======
 3.07
======

There is a new keyword:
EX_M: This behaves a bit like EX in that the calling job continues executing
(like EX and contray to EW) but the job created is owned by the calling job
(like EW). This means that if you get rid of the calling job, you will also get
rid of the created job(s).

A treat for QXL owners: Thanks to Bruno COATIVY, you can now configure whether
what dos drive letters (C:, D: etc) corresponds to win1_, win2_ etc...
Just configure the new SMSQE.EXE file, under the "Host" section.

The Q40 flp density workaround in v. 3.06 now works. This is a 1 byte change
in 1 source file, and I still managed to get it wrong!


======
 3.06
======
The "Quit" keyword takes an optional parameter (long int) that is passed to
the calling job. For example, you could have two basic programs,
the first calling the second with
   return_code=FEW(your_second_program)

The Q40 flp density is preset to High (1.44 MB disks). This is a workaround
for a bug that stops flp format working if the drive was never accessed before
and no flp density was set explicitly. If you want to format other density
disks you must set the density to D or E.

Sprites (of 6x10 size) may be used as cursor. See the documentation in
dev8_extras_new_cursor_txt

Attempt to have Gold Card Miracle hard disks working again.



=============
 3.04 & 3.05
=============
Simple bug fixes
Display bug fix
The smsqemake_exe program takes new parameters (see the doc in the
_extras_help dir)



======
 3.03
======
1 - Many bugfixes

2 - A new cachecontrol module for the Q60, based on Code kindly supplied by
Mark Swift.
This introduces three new keywords which were contained in Mark Swift's
Cachemodes toolkit that comes with the Qx0:

SERIALIZED
This turns the Caches OFF

WRITETHROUGH
This command turns the "writethrough" cache mode of 68040 &
68060 processors ON. Writing to a memory address writes both to the
cache and to memory, so cache and memory are always in sync.


COPYBACK
This command turns the copyback cache mode of 68040 & 68060
processors ON. Enabling the COPYBACK cache can give substantial
speed increases. Writing to a memory address will write to the
cache, but not to memory until absolutely necessary. Thus cache
and memory are rarely in sync.
This can lead to some incompatibilities.
With these three keywords, you can use the cache mode you want.
You can configure in what state your machine should boot.

3 -Left and right shift keys are handled separately:
Up to now, if you pressed both shift keys at once and then released only one,
the system also considered that you had released the other.

 
4 - INPUT uses F10 (or any other configured keystroke) to put the content of
the "console" channel into the stuffer buffer in a READ/EDIT line trap (only!).
You can configure the keystroke with the usual configuration program.
You must input a number between 0 and 255. This corresponds to the keycode
of the key in question.
If you are unsure about what key produces what code, you could do the following:
Type in:    PRINT CODE ( INKEY$ (-1) )
followed by Enter into any Sbasic.
Now hit the key you want to use. The corresponding number will be printed
on the screen.
This is 250 for the suggested F10 key.

 3.02

Bugfixes


======
 3.01
======

Apart from some small bugfixes , in this version there is a new routine to
move the windows about the screen.

There are now three ways this can be done:

0 - the old way - the pointer changes to the "move window" sprite which is
moved about the screen.

1 - "Outline": the outline of the window is moved with the mouse

2 - Full window : the entire indow is moved with the mouse

Please read the "move_txt' documentation for more details.



On a more anecdotical scale, the doc, exe, help, new subdirectories
have all been moved into the extras subdirectory.


There is also a new program that will (or is supposed to) make compilation
of the sources a bit easier. This is  extras_exe_smsqemake. The documentation
is in extras_help_smsqemake_doc or _txt


----
3.00
----


SMSQ/E version 3.00 comes with many new features, notably:

*  a new window manager, WMAN, which has:
			
   - more colours usable from WMAN
   - system palettes usable by jobs
   - more sprite forms are implemented (different modes)
   - sprites that can use alpha blending and RLE compression
   - sprites in loose items that may change according to the status of the item
     (for all : see display_txt)

*  system sprites are handled completely differently, it is expected that
   the list will be extended

*  background colours no longer take up memory

*  New keywords (FEX etc) for extended job control
     (see doc_FEX_txt)

*  a help index for those using QD, useful for finding a file containing a
   certain label (see doc_help_index_txt).

* better Q40 disk partitions handling
