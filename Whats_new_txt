As of versions 3.00, this file contains a brief overview of what is new in
each version of SMSQ/E.


A more detailed description of the changes made to the source code itself
is contained in changes_txt.

Moreover, there is a directory called "New".

This contains documentation on the new features that are introduced with this
new version of SMSQ/E,to the extent that such documentation exists.
Please note that, for the sake of completeness, the same documentation also
exists in the "doc" directory. At each new version of SMSQ/E the content of the
